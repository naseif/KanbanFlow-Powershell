# Get-KBFTimeUsageOverview

*Creates a time usage overview for a time span*

We do a weekly reporting about our time usage.

And that is what this is for. You can give that
function a time span. Do not care about the time part
on the datetimes you pass in. The function will remove
the time part and make sure both days are fully included.
