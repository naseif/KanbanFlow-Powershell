# Kanbanflow Powershell Module

This powershell module gives you access to the kanbanflow api making it easy
to integrate it with administrative tasks, devops tasks and your general 
self organization.

It is compatible from Powershell 5 and 6 alike so use it from Windows, Linux or Mac. 

  - Create Tasks from events, log entries, ...
  - Write your own automated analysis of your work ...
  - Visualize workflows or information in other systems by converting it into a nice kanban board
  
Look into the "Documentation" link up there in the header to find a nice searchable help
generated directly from the help content which is also embedded in the module itself and 
thus available from powershell command line as well.
